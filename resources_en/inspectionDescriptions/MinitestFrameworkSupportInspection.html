    This inspection warns about missing 'minitest-reporters' gem, which is required for test runner feature.
    Minitest is a lightweight version of original Test::Unit framework. So please install 'minitest-reporters'
    gem or use older full featured Test::Unit framework version, provided by 'test-unit' gem.
